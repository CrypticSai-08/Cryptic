# 128-bit AES Encryption and Decryption

## Synopsis
This project includes encryption and decryption programs written in C++ to help you understand the 128-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) cipher.

## File Details
- `encrypt.cpp`: Source file for the encryption utility.
- `decrypt.cpp`: Source file for the decryption utility.
- `structures.h`: Provides the structures and key expansion functions for use in the main program files.
- `keyfile`: Specify the encryption key in this file. The key must be a 128-bit key in hexadecimal format with a space between each hex value, for example: `01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F 10`.
- `message.aes`: Generated by the encryption tool, this file stores the encrypted message and can be read in and decrypted by the decryption tool.

## Compilation
If you are using the `g++` compiler, you can compile the programs as follows:

```shell
g++ encrypt.cpp -o encrypt
g++ decrypt.cpp -o decrypt

## Usage
To run the encryption utility, simply execute the following command after compilation:
 ./encrypt
To run the decryption utility, use the following command after compilation:
 ./decrypt
